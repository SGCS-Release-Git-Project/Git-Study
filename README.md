# SGCS Release Git Study

Sogang University's SGCS Release Club conducted a Git Study from March 24, 2024, to May 12, 2024, aiming to become experts in using Git/GitHub.

## Study Topics

Throughout the study, we explored the following key Git functionalities:

* ✅ **Systematic Source Code Management** (`add`, `commit`, `push`)
* ✅ **Structured Collaboration** (`branch`, `pull request`)
* ✅ **Conflict Management in Collaboration** (`pull – rebase O`, `rebase X`)
* ✅ **Version Control** (`tag`)
* ✅ **Local Git Management** (`restore`, `checkout`, `status`)
* ✅ **Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions**

Additionally, each study session involved applying the theory learned by solving algorithmic problems using Streamlit, which helped participants fully internalize the concepts.
